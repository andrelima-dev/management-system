# Jungle Gaming Task System

Monorepo Turborepo scaffold for the Jungle Gaming Full-stack Challenge. This repository contains backend microservices built with NestJS and a React frontend sharing common tooling and types.

## Structure

- `apps/` — application packages (API Gateway, Auth, Tasks, Notifications, Web UI)
- `packages/` — shared libraries (types, utils, lint, tsconfig, UI helpers)
- `docker-compose.yml` — service orchestration for local development

Implementation details will be completed in subsequent iterations.
